## Description

Create a unified layout system using shared components to ensure consistency across all screens. Extract reusable UI components and establish consistent spacing, elevation, and layout patterns following Material 3 Expressive design principles.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared TopBar component created and used across all screens
- [ ] Unified spacing system implemented (8dp base grid)
- [ ] Consistent elevation patterns applied (1dp cards 2dp search 6dp FAB)
- [ ] Shared Surface components for consistent background/elevation
- [ ] Common layout containers created for consistent screen structure
- [ ] Typography hierarchy consistently applied across all screens
- [ ] Shared animation and motion components implemented

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a design system directory structure for shared components
2. Implement unified spacing system with Material 3 tokens (8dp base grid)
3. Create shared TopBar component that can be reused across screens
4. Implement consistent elevation system (1dp cards, 2dp search, 6dp FAB)
5. Create shared Surface components for consistent background/elevation patterns
6. Develop common layout containers for screen structure consistency
7. Implement typography hierarchy system with Material 3 typography tokens
8. Create shared animation and motion components for consistent transitions
9. Migrate existing screens to use the new shared components
10. Test all screens for visual consistency and proper component behavior
