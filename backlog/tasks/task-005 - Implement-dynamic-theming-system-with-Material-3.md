## Description

Enhance the existing Material 3 theming system to support comprehensive customization including light/dark modes and user-selectable accent colors. This improves visual appeal and user personalization while ensuring Material 3 consistency.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Light Dark and System theme modes implemented
- [x] User can select accent color from predefined palette
- [x] Theme preference stored in DataStore
- [x] Color scheme follows Material 3 guidelines
- [x] Dynamic theming applies across all screens
- [x] Theme changes are applied immediately without restart
- [x] Improve Material 3 theming consistency across components

## Implementation Plan

1. Migrate MyApplicationTheme from Material 1 to Material 3 ColorScheme system
2. Add accent color preferences to PreferencesRepository with validation
3. Create Material 3 ColorScheme generator with predefined accent color palette
4. Update App.kt to apply new theme system with immediate updates
5. Add accent color picker UI to SettingsScreen
6. Test theme changes across all screens and ensure Material 3 consistency
7. Update all Material 1 component imports to Material 3 throughout codebase

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented dynamic theming system with Material 3:

## Features Implemented
- **Complete Material 3 Migration**: Migrated from Material 1 to Material 3 theming system with proper ColorScheme usage
- **Accent Color System**: Added 6 predefined Material 3 compliant accent colors (Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, Teal)
- **DataStore Integration**: Extended PreferencesRepository with accent color preferences and validation
- **Dynamic ColorScheme Generation**: Created Material3ColorScheme utility that generates light/dark color schemes based on accent color selection
- **Settings UI**: Added accent color picker with visual color swatches in SettingsScreen
- **Immediate Updates**: Theme and accent color changes apply instantly without restart
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added ThemeSystemTest to validate theme switching and accent color logic

## Technical Decisions
- Maintained LocalCustomColors for backward compatibility during transition
- Used Material 3's recommended color tokens and contrast ratios
- Implemented proper validation for accent color preferences
- Created modular ColorScheme generation for easy maintenance
- Used reactive StateFlow for immediate theme updates

- Material3ColorScheme.kt: New utility for dynamic ColorScheme generation
- MyApplicationTheme.kt: Migrated from Material 1 to Material 3
- App.kt: Updated to use new theme system with accent color support
