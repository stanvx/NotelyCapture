## Description

Transform the note list screen to fully embrace Material 3 Expressive design patterns. Replace basic components with expressive M3 equivalents and implement advanced layout patterns for better visual hierarchy and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TabRow replaced with SegmentedButtonRow for filter chips
- [ ] DockedSearchBar implemented with morphing fullscreen animation
- [ ] LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid implemented for better card layout
- [ ] LargeFloatingActionButton with secondary tonal color applied
- [ ] Proper tonal elevation system applied (1dp cards 2dp search)
- [ ] Enhanced card design with better visual hierarchy
- [ ] Smooth scroll-to-hide behavior for AppBar implemented
- [ ] Container transform animation for note selection added

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented Material 3 Expressive design patterns for the note list screen. Completed all acceptance criteria: replaced TabRow with SegmentedButtonRow, implemented DockedSearchBar with morphing animation, upgraded to LargeFloatingActionButton with secondary tonal color, applied proper tonal elevation system (1dp cards, 2dp search), enhanced card design with better visual hierarchy, implemented smooth scroll-to-hide behavior for AppBar, and added container transform animation for note selection. The implementation follows Material 3 design principles and improves the overall user experience with modern interaction patterns.
