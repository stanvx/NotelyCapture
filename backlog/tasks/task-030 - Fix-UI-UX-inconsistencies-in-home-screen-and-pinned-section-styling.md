## Description

Address three specific UI/UX inconsistencies identified from user screenshots: 1) 'Voice & Text' section being cut off in the banner of the main page, 2) Gradient on homescreen that doesn't fit with the app's Material 3 theming, and 3) Pinned microphone icon that appears out of place and poorly embedded in the design. These issues affect visual cohesion and user experience across the capture hub and home screens.

## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Voice & Text section displays completely without truncation in CaptureHubScreen banner
- [ ] Gradient styling in NoteListHeader harmonizes with Material 3 theme colors and design tokens
- [ ] Pinned microphone icon integrates seamlessly with surrounding design elements and color scheme
- [ ] All changes maintain Material 3 design compliance and accessibility standards
- [ ] Visual consistency is achieved across capture hub and home screen components
