## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Material 2 components replaced with Material 3 equivalents
- [ ] NoteDetailScreen uses Material 3 Scaffold with proper behavior
- [ ] All FloatingActionButtons migrated to Material 3 variants
- [ ] AlertDialogs replaced with Material 3 dialog components
- [ ] No mixed M2/M3 component usage across the app
