## Description

Apply Compose performance optimizations to reduce unnecessary recompositions and improve UI responsiveness

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stable parameters are extracted in all composables
- [ ] Expensive calculations use remember appropriately
- [ ] derivedStateOf is implemented where needed
- [ ] Recomposition debugging tools are added
- [ ] UI responsiveness is measurably improved
