## Description

Create a centralized motion theming system following Material 3 motion specifications. Replace hard-coded animation values with semantic motion tokens and implement consistent animation patterns across all UI interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MotionTokens.kt file created with M3 motion specifications
- [ ] All hard-coded animation durations replaced with motion tokens
- [ ] Spring animations implemented (700ms 0.6f damping)
- [ ] Container transform transitions added for navigation
- [ ] Fade-through and shared-axis transitions implemented
- [ ] Motion reduction accessibility setting respected
- [ ] Haptic feedback integrated with animation timing
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth 60fps animations
