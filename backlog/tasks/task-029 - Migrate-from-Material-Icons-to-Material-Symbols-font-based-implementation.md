- [ ] Custom icon helper functions are created for easy usage
- [ ] All existing icons continue to work with updated styling
- [ ] Documentation is updated with usage guidelines

## Implementation Plan

1. Copy Material Symbols font files to Android resources\n2. Create MaterialSymbols FontFamily definition\n3. Create icon helper classes and extension functions\n4. Create Material Symbols icon mappings\n5. Migrate all existing icon usages systematically\n6. Update theme and type definitions\n7. Test all icon usages across the app\n8. Update documentation
