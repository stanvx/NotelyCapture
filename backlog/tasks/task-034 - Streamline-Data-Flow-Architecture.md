## Description

Combine and optimize data flow streams to reduce duplicate processing and improve performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search and filter logic are combined into single stream
- [ ] Smart state diffing prevents unnecessary updates
- [ ] Sealed class states are used for performance tracking
- [ ] Duplicate processing paths are eliminated
- [ ] Data flow performance is measurably improved
