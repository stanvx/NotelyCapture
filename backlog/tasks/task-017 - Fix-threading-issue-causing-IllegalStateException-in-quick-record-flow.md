## Description

Fix IllegalStateException: Method setCurrentState must be called on the main thread error that occurs when using quick record functionality. The error is caused by background thread operations triggering UI state changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error no longer occurs during quick record flow
- [ ] Navigation callbacks execute on main thread
- [ ] Transcription callbacks execute on main thread
- [ ] All UI state changes happen on main thread

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze stack trace to identify root cause\n2. Fix Transcriber.android.kt WhisperCallback threading\n3. Fix BackgroundTranscriptionService callback threading\n4. Ensure all UI state changes happen on main thread\n5. Test quick record flow to verify fix

## Implementation Notes

Fixed critical threading issue in quick record flow. Root cause: WhisperCallback methods and BackgroundTranscriptionService callbacks were executing on background threads but triggering UI updates and navigation. Applied fixes: 1) Updated Transcriber.android.kt to wrap all WhisperCallback invocations in MainScope().launch{} 2) Updated BackgroundTranscriptionService to use withContext(Dispatchers.Main) for all callback invocations 3) Added proper coroutine imports. All UI state changes now happen on main thread as required by Android Lifecycle components.
