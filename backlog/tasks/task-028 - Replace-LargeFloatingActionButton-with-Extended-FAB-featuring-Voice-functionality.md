## Description

Replace the current LargeFloatingActionButton on the homescreen with an Extended FAB that displays 'Voice' with a microphone icon. The FAB should be expressive, link to the existing Quick Record function, and use LazyListState to minimize when scrolling through captures. This should integrate with the ongoing unified action buttons system work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extended FAB replaces LargeFloatingActionButton on home screen
- [ ] FAB displays 'Voice' text with microphone icon
- [ ] FAB links to existing Quick Record functionality
- [ ] FAB minimizes/extends based on LazyListState scroll behavior
- [ ] FAB follows Material 3 expressive design guidelines
- [ ] Integration with unified action buttons system is seamless
- [ ] Existing Quick Record functionality remains intact
