## Description

Enable users to pause and resume audio recordings during capture. This is a core UX improvement that allows for more flexible recording workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AudioRecorder interface includes pause() and resume() methods
- [ ] Android implementation uses MediaRecorder pause/resume
- [ ] iOS implementation uses AVAudioRecorder pause/record
- [ ] Recording state properly tracks paused/resumed status
- [ ] UI displays pause/resume button during recording

## Implementation Notes

Feature validation: Pause/resume functionality for AudioRecorder is already fully implemented.

**Complete Implementation Found:**

1. **AudioRecorder Interface** (core/audio/src/commonMain/kotlin/audio/recorder/AudioRecorder.kt:8-9):
   - pauseRecording() method
   - resumeRecording() method  
   - isPaused() method

2. **Platform Implementations**:
   - **Android** (AudioRecorder.android.kt:108-123): Uses MediaRecorder pause/resume
   - **iOS** (AudioRecorder.ios.kt:130-145): Uses AVAudioRecorder pause/record

3. **Domain Layer** (AudioRecorderInteractor.kt:22-23):
   - onPauseRecording(coroutineScope: CoroutineScope)
   - onResumeRecording(coroutineScope: CoroutineScope)

4. **State Management** (AudioRecorderPresentationState.kt:6):
   - isRecordPaused: Boolean field properly tracks pause state

5. **UI Implementation** (RecordingScreen.kt:269-278):
   - Pause/resume button with proper icon switching (IcPause ↔ PlayArrow)
   - Conditional logic to call appropriate action based on isRecordPaused state
   - Full integration with ViewModel pause/resume methods

**All acceptance criteria are already met:**
✅ AudioRecorder interface includes pause() and resume() methods
✅ Android implementation uses MediaRecorder pause/resume  
✅ iOS implementation uses AVAudioRecorder pause/record
✅ Recording state properly tracks paused/resumed status
✅ UI displays pause/resume button during recording

No implementation work required - feature is production-ready.
